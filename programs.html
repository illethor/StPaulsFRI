							Income Tax Returns
						</h4>
						<p style="font-weight: 550;">
							Preparation of income tax returns for low and fixed income individuals and families. We currently partner with Canada Revenue Agency and their volunteers. We completed over 275 returns last year with more anticipated this current year. 
						</p>
						<p style="font-weight: 550;">This program helps so many people complete their tax returns so they can access much needed benefits like: the GST credit rebate, Nova Scotia Affordable Living allowance and the Canada Child Benefit.
						</p>
						<p style="font-weight: 550;">This year we gathered together  a focus group so that the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program coordinators could evaluate the program by finding out who uses the program, and understand the impact they are making.

							School Break Camps
						</h4>
						<p style="font-weight: 550;">
							A fun and active environment for children ages 5-12. We try to offer the camps at a low cost for the parents to ensure they are in a safe and happy environment with minimal cost to the participants. This Summer, we offered camp for 7 weeks and had about 15 campers each week. We were able to hire 4 leaders this year. Each week, they went on a full day trip which included: the waterfront to see the Buskers, the Discovery Centre, Crystal Crescent Beach and other trips around Halifax.
						</p>
						<p style="font-weight: 550;"> The Summer camp also went swimming at Kidston Lake and Long Lake beach, attended programs at the Library, and swam at the wave pool! We also held a few barbeques throughout the Summer in the garden which everyone enjoyed.

						CHRISTMAS

					<article style="width:75%;">
						<h4 style="font-weight: 625; text-transform: uppercase;">
							Christmas Support Program
						</h4>
						<p style="font-weight: 550;">
							Providing low-income families and individuals with the resources to celebrate the Christmas season. This is our largest program that we run in the year.
						</p>
						<p style="font-weight: 550;">We helped over 200 individuals and families in the past year, and foresee this number remaining the same for the current year. We could not have done this without the over 100 volunteers who join us to help make Christmas extra special for people. In order to ensure we had enough food for our clients, Sobeys Spryfield generously donated over $1900 in groceries. Additionally, we were fortunate to be able to partner with PA Yeoman Marine Services again this year, who offered us a freezer unit to store the turkeys overnight.
						</p>
						<p style="font-weight: 550;">Along with these two community partners and our volunteers, we had so many others who helped us make Christmas bright for our patrons.

					<article style="width:75%;">
						<h4 style="font-weight: 625; text-transform: uppercase;">
							Christmas Toy Store
						</h4>
						<p style="font-weight: 550;">
							Providing all families who have registered with the Christmas Support Program with toys for their children. The parents are taken into our Toy Store and given the chance to choose toys for their children. It is always great to give this opportunity to parents. This year we had two groups who donated a lot of toys, which increased our quantity and quality of toys.
						</p>
						<p style="font-weight: 550;">The first was Canadian Tire Spryfield, who donated over $2000 worth of toys, and the other was the Halifax Hurricanes Ringette 1B team, who donated almost $400 worth of toys! This year, Feed Nova Scotia continued with their Hearts for Christmas campaign, and we were able to give families with children (who were registered) a $40 Walmart giftcard, offering them even more choice.

						FOOD BANK
					</h3>
					<article style="width:75%;">
						<h4 style="font-weight: 625; text-transform: uppercase;">
							Main Food Bank
						</h4>
						<p style="font-weight: 550;">
							The food bank is our biggest continuous program. We help about 120 - 130 people each month. This year (2018), we participed in Hunger Count, a collection of client demographic data who are using the food bank. We continue to run our Brain Food Fridays at J. L. Isley. We put together a box of food that is distributed by the Public Health nurse to students who do not have access to food when the school is closed.
						</p>
						<p style="font-weight: 550;"> We have continued to support the Greystone Community with food bank assistance and will continue to do so at the new community centre of the GCA Society for Community and Family (9 Cranberry Court). 
						</p>
						<p style="font-weight: 550;">Over the course of the year, we've received many donations from other churches including: St. James United Church, Parkhill United Church, St. Paul's Roman Catholic Church, St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church and St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church. We also received food from a number of local schools. Of course, we also have a great group of volunteers who come and help us weekly. Without them, we would never be able to do the job that we do.
						</p>

						<p style="font-weight: 550;">
							This year alone, we assisted approximately 750 families with weekly food bank orders. In August (2018), we began to give out backpacks to clients with children, filled with school supplies.

					<article style="width:75%;">
						<h4 style="font-weight: 625; text-transform: uppercase;">
							A LOOK BACK ON 2018 AND OUR <strong>25<sup>th</sup></strong> ANNIVERSARY
						</h4>
						<p style="font-weight: 550;">
							It was another beautiful year in the garden. This year marks our <strong>25<sup>th</sup></strong> anniversary! We recognized this milestone in August by holding a barbeque for our gardeners which included live music.
						</p>
						<p style="font-weight: 550;">This year we held another strew dinner and auction in September, which was another resounding success, raising nearly $2000! Furthermore, two Summer students were hired to help maintain both the garden as well as the Nordic Walking Trail. They did an amazing job, along with the help of outside groups such as the United Way Day of Caring.
						</p>
						<p style="font-weight: 550;">We were excited this year to receive a Building Vibrant Communities grant to be able to pilot a program that teaches people how to garden. Through February and March 2018, we met with food bank clients to talk about gardening. We invited those who were interested to take part in a new project, to have a garden plot in our community garden. There was no past experience required!
